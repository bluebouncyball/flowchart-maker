# flowchart-maker

## What is the purpose?
For this repository, my goal is to create my own functioning flowchart creator fit with multiple object types, resize and movement abilities, text overlays, and arrow connections that can update realtime.

## Where is the code now?
Currently, mutliple object types, resizing, and dragging abilities have been created.
The code is using the tkinter module and its canvas capabilities to draw various shapes used in flowcharts.

## What are you looking for?
I am mainly looking for an efficient way to create a working arrow connection system that can create intuitive arrow bends and goes around the objects without colliding.
However, I would love to be able to get information from higher level programmers on things I can do to refine my code as well as other QOL systems I can impliment.

## Who is the creator?
I am extremely new to the programming space and everything to do with Github. This is basically my first repository and first time touching Github. I only have about 2 months of experience in Python as well.
